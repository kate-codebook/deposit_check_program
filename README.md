# deposit_check_program
designed for my mother to use the program at her workplace => hours work reduced to minutes work 

her main duty : check whether business partners made payments accordingly 
To accomplish the above duty, she had to manually: 
1) look up 4 bank statements from 4 different accounts on daily basis
2) log into government taxation infrastructure website and find out the $amounts she needs to check for. 
3) look up previous payment history from each month excel sheet. 
3) record newly found payment onto new month excel sheet. 

for easy access and control, the codes were provided with colab link for a user-friendly environment
